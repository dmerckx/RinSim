/**
 * RoadModel is a model that manages a fleet of vehicles ({@link RoadUser}s) on
 * top of a <i>space</i>. The space that is used depends on the specific
 * implementation of {@link RoadModel}. {@link RoadUser}s have a position which
 * is represented by a {@link Point}. Generally, RoadModels are responsible for:
 * <ul>
 * <li>adding and removing objects</li>
 * <li>moving objects around</li>
 * </ul>
 * On top of that the RoadModel provides several functions for retrieving
 * objects and finding the shortest path. More utilities for working with
 * {@link RoadModel}s are defined in {@link RoadModels}.
